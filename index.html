				<h4>About</h4>
				<p> "Because It's There" is a 2D mountain climbing game developed for CMPT 306 Game Mechanics.  The goal of this project was 
				to teach us the fundamentals of game development. For this game, we focused on one main technical component: Procedural Generation.
				Each level is procedurally generated, with the goal of the user to get as high up the mountain as possible. The higher the user 
				gets up the mountain, the more difficult it becomes. A random weather generator will create stronger winds, more precipitation, 
				and questionable platforms to grab onto. The player can move left and right, jump, and shoot a grappling hook to attach to 
				ledges and swing higher up. The game also involves a competitive multiplayer mode, where you can compete with another player to 
				reach the top of the mountain first.</p>

				<h4>Languages: C#</h4>
				<h4>Platforms: Unity, Microsoft Visual Studio, Oculus Rift</h4>
				<h4>About</h4>
				<p> The V-Rad Veterinary Medical Software was a school project done in Dr.Osgood's CMPT 371 Software Management
				class. The project was meant to simulate a client-developer relationship where groups of eleven students (each 
				with assigned roles) would develop a application for a client based on their needs and specifications.  Our project 
				involved creating a virtual reality application for Dr. Mike Wesolowski.  The application was meant to be a replacement 
				for the traditional radiologists' workstation where they can view x-rays, ultrasounds, cat scans, and other medical images 
				within a 3D virtual environment. Users can load in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files and be able 
				to view the patient information associated with each image.  The users can then manipulate and move the images in various 
				ways that are used by radiologists to examine and make diagnosis'. My role in the project was the Lead Developer, which involved 
				assigning tasks to other developers, coming up with both a requirements and design document, and ensuring everyone's 
				coding tasks got completed for each of our deadlines (including  my own). We had also decided  to enter our project in the 
				2017 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) challenge to compete against other innovative medical software being 
				developed by students in North America.</p>

					<h4>Languages: C#</h4>

					<h4>About</h4>
					<p>The Virtual Reality UI Project is a group research project that aimed to determine some basic best practises 
					in VR interfaces.  As a newly available technology to develop with, there is currently no standard for creating 
					intuitive interfaces in a VR environment, which can make developing a new game or application difficult.  
					This study attempts to address this issue by performing analysis on the performance of various button designs, 
					textures, and feedback types in a VR environment.  These results can help to define the building blocks for a new standard 
					in development of VR interfaces, making it easier and more accessible for developers to create VR applications.</p>
